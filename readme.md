This is my practice c# repository.
I'd like to contribute to this repository as much as possible.
If anyone would like to use this repository to practice their c# skills as well feel free.
Also, what has helped me is using mono to execute my c# code during runtime.

mcs <name of your c# file>
mono <name of your c# executible>

Thank you
